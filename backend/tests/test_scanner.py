"""Tests for the library scanner with real audio files.

These tests use CC0-licensed audio files stored in tests/fixtures/audio/
to verify scanner functionality including:
- File discovery (including subdirectories)
- Metadata extraction
- Hash computation
- Hash-based track matching (deduplication)

Audio fixtures from: https://github.com/SoundSafari/CC0-1.0-Music

Audio fixtures structure:
