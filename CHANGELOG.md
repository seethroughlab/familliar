### Changed

- **Comprehensive mobile layout audit** - fixed 26 components for better mobile experience

  - Data fetching moved to parent components for cleaner architecture
- **Improved album artwork fallbacks** - tracks and albums now use AlbumArtwork component with hash-based fallback

### Fixed

- **Visualizer stability** - fixed useEffect dependency bug causing objects to flicker/respawn every frame
  - Affected both Rain Window (bokeh lights) and Non-Places (silhouettes)
  - Root cause: `audioData` in dependency array caused effect to re-run on every frame
- **Plant frond rotation** - fronds now point upward correctly instead of sideways
  - Added -π/2 offset to canvas rotation so angle 0 means "up" not "right"
  - Affects both potted plant and palm tree shapes
- **Playlist detail overflow** - header now stacks vertically on mobile, preventing title/button clipping
- **Track skipping during queue changes** - fixed race condition where tracks could skip unexpectedly
  - Added transition tracking to ignore spurious "ended" events during queue/track loading
  - Prevents double-advancing when rapidly changing tracks
- **iOS background playback** - audio now continues playing when app is backgrounded on iOS
  - Implemented hybrid audio mode that switches between Web Audio (for visualizer) and direct playback (for background)
  - Default: uses direct playback for reliable background audio
  - When visualizer is visible: switches to Web Audio mode for visualizer to work
  - When app backgrounds or visualizer closes: switches back to direct playback
  - Audio effects not available on iOS (they require Web Audio routing which breaks background playback)

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-01-11 to 2026-01-14

Discovery & Metadata Intelligence

### Added

  - MusicBrainz integration for looking up correct metadata
  - Cover Art Archive integration for album artwork
- **Proposed Changes indicator** in header bar
  - Amber badge shows count of pending changes
  - Click for quick preview popover

  - Handles diacritics (Björk = Bjork), quotes, dashes, and whitespace variations
  - Applied to album grouping, artwork hash computation, and compilation detection
- **Duplicate artist detection** LLM tools
  - `find_duplicate_artists` - detects artists with variant spellings (e.g., "Arovane_Phonem" vs "Arovane and Phonem")
  - `merge_duplicate_artists` - proposes merging duplicates via the review queue
- **Proposed Changes as main view** - now accessible from Library browser picker
  - Click the amber indicator to jump directly to the Proposed Changes view
  - Removed from Settings panel (now has its own dedicated view)
  - Improved card layout with more space for reviewing changes
- **Semantic search** for natural language music queries
  - New `semantic_search` LLM tool uses CLAP text embeddings
  - Ask for "gloomy with Eastern influences" or "dreamy atmospheric synths" and find sonically matching tracks
  - Works by encoding your text description into the same embedding space as the audio
  - Gracefully falls back to metadata search when CLAP is disabled

### Changed

- Music Map now uses ego-centric layout instead of UMAP projection (scales beyond 200 artists)
- **Artwork fetch order** - Last.fm checked first when API key is configured (faster than MusicBrainz)
- **Background Jobs indicator** now shows queue count (e.g., "5/10 (3 queued)")
- **Bulk change display** - shows unique values instead of raw JSON with track IDs
  - Before: `{"uuid1":"proem","uuid2":"Proem",...}`
  - After: `proem, Proem`

### Fixed

- Broken image placeholders - Music Map and 3D Explorer now show Music icon instead of broken image link
- Header popovers (Background Jobs, Proposed Changes, Health) now display above album art
  - Added proper z-index stacking: header z-30, PlayerBar z-20, popovers z-60
- Settings page crash caused by API responses not being arrays
- Proposed Changes API endpoint missing trailing slash

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-01-04 to 2026-01-09

Infrastructure & Library UX

### Added

- Memory tracking in analysis subprocess for debugging OOM issues
- **Split analysis into separate phases** for better memory efficiency
  - Phase 1: Feature extraction (librosa, artwork, AcoustID) - ~1-2GB memory

  - Each phase runs in its own subprocess that exits after completion
  - Peak memory reduced from ~5GB to ~3GB, works on 4GB containers
- **Updated sync UI** to show 4 phases: Discover → Read → Features → Embeddings
- **Environment variable** `DISABLE_CLAP_EMBEDDINGS=true` to skip embedding phase
- **Artist images** in library browser with fallback chain (Last.fm → Spotify → album artwork)
- **Infinite scroll** for all library views (Artists, Albums, Tracks)
- **View persistence** - app remembers your selected library view
- **Track metadata editing** - right-click any track and select "Edit Metadata..."
  - Tabbed modal with Basic, Extended, Sort, Lyrics, and Analysis tabs
  - Edit core fields: title, artist, album, album artist, track/disc number, year, genre
  - Edit extended fields: composer, conductor, lyricist, grouping, comment
  - Edit sort fields for proper alphabetization (e.g., "Beatles, The")
  - Edit embedded lyrics
  - Override detected BPM and key values
  - Option to write changes back to audio file tags (MP3, FLAC, M4A, OGG, AIFF)
- **Context menu everywhere** - full context menu now available on:
  - Player bar (currently playing track)
  - Full player overlay
  - Artist detail page
  - Favorites list
  - Playlist detail
  - All library browser views
- **Auto-enrich metadata** when viewing artist detail page - triggers enrichment for all tracks

### Changed

- Add restart policies to postgres and redis containers in docker-compose
- Disable Docker layer cache for more reliable builds
- More aggressive disk cleanup during Docker build
- Extended Track database model with new metadata fields
- Improved MusicBrainz release selection (prefers original albums over compilations)

### Fixed

- Rate-limited ProcessPoolExecutor recreation to prevent runaway process spawning
- Increased file descriptor limit to prevent EMFILE errors during bulk analysis
- Detect and clear stale sync locks on every sync attempt
- Install PyTorch after uv sync to prevent package removal during build
- Configure logging in analysis subprocess for better debugging
- Reduce uvicorn workers to 1 to prevent OOM during analysis
- Library Sync progress bar now correctly shows progress during Features and Embeddings phases
- **Compilation album duplication** - Albums like "80's Wave" no longer appear multiple times
  - Sync now auto-detects compilation albums (multiple artists, no album_artist set)
  - Sets `album_artist = "Various Artists"` for tracks in detected compilations
- Process pool crashing during analysis
- Tab selection now persists in URL hash across page reloads
- Simplify sync queue management to prevent stalls during feature extraction
- Artist detail URL persistence - artist selection now stored in URL, survives page reload
